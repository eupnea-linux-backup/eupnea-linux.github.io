## Crostini specific instructions

The Crostini container needs to be started with special privileges to allow for loop devices to be mounted. **These
instructions are mandatory each time for Crostini.**

## Instructions:

1. Set up "Linux" in the ChromeOS settings. If you already have it set up, skip this step.
2. Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd><kbd>ALT</kbd><kbd>T</kbd> to open the ChromeOS terminal
3. Type ``shell`` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
4. Paste the command from below and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

```shell
vmc stop termina; vmc start termina | exit; vmc container termina penguin --privileged true 2>/dev/null 1>/dev/null; sleep 10; vmc container termina penguin --privileged true
```

- If you get an error about `shell` not being a command:
  [Enable developer mode](https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-enable-developer-mode-on-a-chromebook-906688/) and
  try again.
- If you get `LXD was configured to only allow unprivileged containers`:
