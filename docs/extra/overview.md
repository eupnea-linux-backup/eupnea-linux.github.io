# The Eupnea Project

Welcome to the Eupnea Project wiki. Below you can find a short overview of the Eupnea Project Products.

## Depthboot

Depthboot is a builder script that creates a bootable USB drive/SD-card that can be booted on any x86_64
Chromebook. It supports common Linux distributions(Pop!_OS, Ubuntu, Arch and Fedora) and a variety of the most popular
desktop environments.  
[Due to licensing restraints, Depthboot cannot be distributed as an iso.](/faq#why-is-sharing-depthboot-images-illegal)
Instead, it has to be build locally.

## EupneaOS

The Eupnea Project develops a custom Linux distribution based on [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) called EupneaOS. It's
designed to imitate the look of ChromeOS and is the recommended way of upgrading your Chromebook. It is designed to
replicate most features of ChromeOS, but without any limitations.
