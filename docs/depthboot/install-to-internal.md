# Install to internal

This will wipe ChromeOS (or any other installed OS) from your Chromebook's internal drive. It will always be possible
to [restore ChromeOS using a recovery USB](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1080595?hl=en) afterwards.

It's recommended to [set up audio](/docs/depthboot/audio) and confirm all hardware is working correctly(touchpad,
touchscreen, speakers) before proceeding.

To install to internal storage, run: ```install-to-internal``` in a terminal.
