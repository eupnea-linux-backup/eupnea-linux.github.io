This repo contains the eupnea-linux website, built by [Vitepress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/).

## Website Development

In order to work on the website and view it on your machine, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and the [yarn (v2 or higher)](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) package manager installed on your system.

After cloning the repository, run `yarn` to install required dependencies. You can now serve and view the website by running `yarn run dev` and navigating to *localhost:5173*.

For a better coding experience, please note that you may have to manually [enable intellisense](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks) by running `yarn sdks vscode` or `yarn sdks vim`.
